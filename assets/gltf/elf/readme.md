Model downloader is from [https://opengameart.org/content/goth-female-fleur-du-mal]

Elf.gltf model is close to the original (some bones where tweaked for VGE). 

Elf_n.gltf was repositioned and rerigged in Mixamo. Unfortunately Mixamo could not handle elf's skirt.

Both models where exported from blender 2.82 to glTF.
