# Prebuild linux libvgelib.so removed

Prebuild libvgelib.so has been removed from version 0.20.1. 
There are potentially too many distributions and other combinations to support all of them at least for now.

You must follow instruction in [building vgelib](../../docs/build_vgelib.md) to build this library and install it.
